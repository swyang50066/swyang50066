I amÂ Seung-Won YangÂ and a computational research scientist specialized in theÂ **data-driven/physics-based modeling**Â andÂ **numerical simulation**.

My scientific computing skills have been trained through wide research experiences. Carrying out my degrees in Astrophysics, I studied the origin of [high velocity cloud (HVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-velocity_cloud) found throughout galactic halo, gas dynamics and astrochemical evolution of the [molecular clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_cloud), and dynamic interaction between [gas giant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giant) and [protoplanetary disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk). Dealing with into these topics, I learned numerical techniques applied in computational fluid dynamics (AMR, SPH, MFM) and in multi-physics simulation, and contributed on development of numerical solver and physics modules, such as chemical evolution, radiative process, accretion flow, dust physics, fluid-particle interaction, turbulent viscosity, and thermal evolution.

Working as a research scientist at a healthcare startup, I started to handle stuffs of AI algorithms and computer vision tasks. Mainly I studied anatomical segmentation and reinforcement learning based medical imaging, and also contributed on developing lots of algorithms for image processing and geometry analysis. Recently I have been focusing on reinforcement learning based network model optimization, considering generalization and robustness of multi-modal and multi-task able architecture

I would like to be a person who can contribute on solving the real-world problems that we encounter these days. To achieve this purpose, I am trying to be an expert in scientific computing, not limited to artificial intelligence as I have done so far.
