### Hello, there! ðŸ‘‹

I have experienced following technical stuffs:
 - Multi-physics Modeling: N-body Simulation, Particle-Fluid Interaction, Radiative Transfer
 - Computational Fluid Dynamics: Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
 - Computer Vision: Medical Imaging, 3D Vision, SLAM, SfM
 - ML/DL: AutoML, MLOps, Multi-agent RL

Currently, I works as a Machine Learning Engineer operating the whole ML lifecycle in the Autonomous Driving group.
I always welcome discussion, so please do not hesitate to contact me to ask anything! :)
