I'am research scientist dealing with physical model-based simulation and data-driven modeling.

Through my degree course and work career, I have experienced in diverse numerical simulations, such as computational hydrodynamics, multi-physics modeling, image processing, machine/deep learning, reinforcement learning.

I like to discuss novel things, so don't hesitate to contact me to talk about research topics or ask any questions.
