Hello, there!

I am Seung-Won Yang and a computational research scientist specialized in the data-
driven/physics-based modeling and the numerical simulation.
My scientific computing skills have been trained through wide research experiences. Carrying out my degrees in Astrophysics, I studied the high velocity cloud (HVC) found throughout galactic halo, astrochemical evolution of the turbulent molecular clouds, and dynamic interaction between gas giant and protoplanetary disk. During the courses, I naturally learned low-level numerical techniques applied in computational fluid dynamics (AMR, SPH, MFM) and in multi- physics simulation. Also I had developed of numerical solvers including chemical evolution, radiative process, accretion flow, dust physics, fluid-particle interaction, turbulent viscosity, and thermal evolution.  

After graduation, I joined healthcare startup as a research scientist, and that was the first time in which I started to handle AI algorithms relating to medical imaging. Fortunately, I was able to meet various ML/DL tasks that rapidly made me grow up as a ML researcher. Moreover, I successfully led several core research projects to make AI-CAD solution for cardiac system, and in recognition for the achievements, took a role in â€˜AI Research & Medicalâ€™ team lead.  

I would like to be a person who can contribute on solving the real-world problems that we encounter these days. To achieve this purpose, so I am trying to be an expert in scientific computing, not limited to artificial intelligence as I have done so far.
